# JAVA_Swing_ChatApp

"I developed a Java Swing chat application using JFrame that allows users to engage in real-time communication. The application features a user-friendly interface where individuals can easily add other users to create a dynamic group chat environment. This functionality enables seamless interaction and collaboration within the group, making it an effective tool for team communication."
